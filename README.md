🚀 Exciting Project Update! 🚀
I'm thrilled to share a sneak peek of my latest LLM-powered application! This app allows users to analyze media files, including PDFs, images, videos, and audio, using advanced generative AI models. 🎬📄🎧📷
In this example, I've integrated Gemini 1.5 LLM to analyze a video and generate insights. The interface includes options to select the type of media, adjust parameters like Temperature and Top P for creativity and coherence control, and view outputs in real time. 🎉
This project has been a rewarding experience in blending NLP, media processing, and interactive design with Streamlit. Can’t wait to share more updates soon!
